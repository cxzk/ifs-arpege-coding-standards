I8: function calls from inside KPROMA loops
*******************

Inside tight horizontal loops of type DO ``JL=KIDIA,KFDIA``, calls should be restricted to intrinsics.

If a function construct must be used inside the loop, the function shall be pure elemental, so as not
to inhibit compiler vectorization of the loop.
