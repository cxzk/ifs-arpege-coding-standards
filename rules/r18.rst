L18 : copying allocatable arrays
********************************

An array declared in scope as allocatable shall not be copied without dimension specification.

For example, copy 1D array as ``PARR2(:)=PARR1(:)``, and *not* ``PARR2=PARR1``.
The latter form may lead to reallocation of the left-hand-side target array at runtime, which 
is error-prone, and costly.
