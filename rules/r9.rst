I9 : naming of variables, subroutines, modules
**********************************************

The IFS has a historical naming convention, which should be adhered to 
where sensible.

*Variable naming convention*

* Local variables

 * integer : ``Ixxx``
 * real : ``Zxxx``
 * logical : ``LLxxx``
 * derived type : ``YRxxx``

* Argument variables

 * integer : ``Kxxxx``
 * real : ``Pxxx``
 * logical : ``LDxxx``
 * derived type : ``YDxxx``

*Routine naming*

* setup routines should start with subroutines
* TL and AD routines should end with tl and ad respectively

*Module naming*
New modules should end with _mod. The name of the file should match
the name of the module it contains (e.g. ``MODULE EINT`` should be in file eint_mod.F90)
