Welcome to the IFS Python standard!
============================================

Developments to the IFS codebase should aim to adhere to the guidelines
and rules presented in this document.

Guidelines and rules described here are designed to make code easier to read,
easier to maintain, easier to extend, and less prone to bugs.
The code review process for submissions to IFS could aim to check
code against these guidelines.
Rules are also written so as to allow implementation of automatic checking.
