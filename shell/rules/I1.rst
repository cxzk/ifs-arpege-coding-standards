I1 : naming of variables, scripts, functions
**********************************************

File naming
===========

Executable files should have no suffix, e.g. `run_parallel`.

Files containing fragments of scripts, such as include files, libraries, etc.,
should have a suffix reflecting the syntax, e.g. `.bash` or `.ksh`.
