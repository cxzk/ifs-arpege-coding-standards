R18 : include interfaces
************************

**status** : reworded, mentioned elsewhere (L9)

For each called routine there must be a â€œ"#include" statement that includes an explicit interface block for the routine. 
Note that the files containing the explicit interface blocks are automatically generated during compilation.
