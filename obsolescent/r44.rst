R44 : value comparisons
***********************

**status** : guideline rather than rule, mentioned in preamble

Explicitly set variables (parameters, constants, namelist variables,...) should be always exactly 
compared (using==or\=, etc). 
Evaluated variables (that might be subject to roundoff error) should be tested against a reference using a threshold.
