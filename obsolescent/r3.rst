R3 : Cosmetic changes
*********************

**Obsolescent** : is this still relevant with git development everywhere, and shared history?

Avoid cosmetic changes that will make merges difficult (such as re-ordering argument lists and 
USE statements, or changing the indentation of large blocks of code). 
As an exception, cosmetic changes can happen when a routine is heavily modified, and only one 
well identified developer will contribute to the code for the next common cycle.
